# The Competition Database

A community-driven database of academic competitions of various kinds.

## A Healthy Competition Environment

[*"内卷" (Nei Juan)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neijuan) is a modern Chinese term that describes a phenomenon where people are forced to compete with each other in a shallow way that is not beneficial to anyone.

The current system often prioritizes a limited number of prestigious competitions, leading to intense, unproductive competition for limited spots and resources, where students feel immense pressure to participate in these few competitions, regardless of their genuine interests or talents.

It also furtherances a negative culture where students must outcompete each other to be "outstanding", rather than supporting each other to grow and learn.

This project aims to provide as much information as possible about various academic competitions. We hope to empower all students to find a place to demonstrate their talents and interests, reducing the pressure to focus solely on the most popular, highly competitive events.

Detailed information on competition requirements, judging criteria, and past winners can help students make informed decisions, reducing wasted effort, fostering a more strategic approach to competition, and maximizing their takeouts.

We promote peer-to-peer sharing of learning and competition experiences, fostering supportive rather than hostile environments.
